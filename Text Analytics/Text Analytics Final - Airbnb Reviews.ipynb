       "'Lisa is superb hostess, she will treat you like family and provide you with the coziest little home in Asheville which will definitely enhance your experience of the magical town! Just like the Eco-retreat, the Private sunny apartment is a neat little flat with all you need for up to 3 people, the place was impeccable in lovely neighborhood. You can hardly beat this one! This was a lovely little place walking distance from downtown. Lisa was very responsive. My best Airbnb experience yet! Lisa was very nice to work with.  However, we didn\\'t realize that the house was so old.  Normally that would have been okay, but in this case, it meant that the floor above us (where the permanent renters lived) was VERY squeaky.  The first night we stayed there, we couldn\\'t sleep for a while because the people above us were walking around at 3am.  We didn\\'t hear them walking around the next night, but we did the third night.\\r\\nThe apartment was very cute and clean.  It had everything that we needed, and there was even a back yard for us to take our dog out to walk in.  \\r\\nIf you go in the winter, you\\'ll be heating it by wall heaters.  It is close to downtown and right next to a GreenLife grocery store.  The location was very nice. I feel very lucky to have found this beautiful home in Asheville. It was very quiet, clean and well thought out for a guest\\'s needs. I stayed here for a glorious month while attending classes at UNCA. The location and apartment was absolutely perfect. I walked to campus through the woods everyday and walked to downtown almost as often...I could be anywhere in ten minutes but I loved being \"home\" here. It was so peaceful and lush. There\\'s a nice big kitchen, which was awesome because I love to cook and there were beautiful gardens with vegetables and herbs to use. Loved the bathroom, it was like a suite unto itself, huge vanity and a great walk in shower. I also thought the bed was very comfortable and I appreciated the good quality linens and pillows. Lisa made it easy for me to feel at home. She gave me a tour of town and showed me how to find the trail to UNCA and some cool bike trails too...let me borrow her bike, which was really nice. I had a wonderful time, will definitely come back and I highly recommend it! Excellent in every way! Great roomy little apartment, beautiful private backyard and deck, perfect for guests with a dog or even without. Lisa was a friendly, helpful host, would stay there again in a heartbeat.   Lisa was a great host. She even came out to greet us as we pulled into the drive way. The apartment was clean and cozy. Short walk to Broadway and Lexington downtown where a lot of restaurants and bars are located. We enjoyed our stay and will definitely be back. Excellent location for downtown. Needed more cooking facilities for us, but I understand that this is going to change. David is a great guy, and we really enjoyed our stay in a beautiful house that creates the perfect ambience for family time. Slept well, enjoyed local walks, and it was very convenient for visiting our daughter at The University of NC Asheville. Easy walks to great food and entertainment. Much appreciated. -k\\r\\n\\r\\nPS Our little dog was welcome too, with an outdoor run and appreciation of Scooter by David (Scooter sends his thanks, too). Great location, good price.  The apartment suited our needs very well.  We had our 5 month old son left, and everything worked out well.  We were going to bring our dog, but didn\\'t because I wasn\\'t sure how accommodating the back yard would be, but I think it would have been fine as it is a big back yard.    The place was super cute and clean with a great location! You\\'ll have to make sure you bring any luxuries you  might need - soap, shampoo, coffee. Also, the futon in the picute has been replaced with a couch, so the 2nd bed is now the mattress on the floor. Another downside, is the bathroom is in the bedroom, so anyone sleeping in the living room needs to go through the bedroom. Not really ideal for more than two people. The owners live above with some pretty thin floors so you can hear them walking around. There was a party our last night there that didn\\'t end until almost 5:00 am - so we didn\\'t get ANY sleep. Great place if you have dogs though. The yard is amazing and the owners were really nice.  We had a wonderful time in Asheville! The house was centrally-located and beautifully furnished. Lots of outdoor space! Lisa was a fantastic host and helped us plan our weekend stay. I would highly recommend staying here and would stay again here in a heartbeat myself. We stayed at Lisa/David\\'s place for a long Bele Chere weekend. The space is a quirky little basement with a nice big bathroom and a gigantic shower. The location is certainly walkable to downtown if you like to walk (takes about 15 min) and is also close to the botanical gardens at UNCA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe back yard with patio was nice to have, giving a nice view of the adorable neighborhood. Overall, we had a good experience and Lisa was very responsive and helpful during our stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur only complaints would be the slightly awkward use of space in the front room of the apartment, the change of furniture (different couch) from the photos, and the fact that the bed was not the most comfortable.  Sweet little apartment, clean, good light, just north of downtown Asheville. Nice design touches throughout, good sized bathroom. Worked well for cooking some of our own meals. Wi-fi worked well. Unit could use a TV connection and microwave. The little back porch and huge backyard made this feel like home. My husband is an architect and we are landlords ourselves, this apartment really impressed.\\r\\n\\r\\nImmediate neighborhood has coffee shop and grocery stores, and is good for walking the dog. Downtown Asheville also impressed us with vibrant, interesting shops and restaurants, and the larger area is great: The Biltmore Estate, hiking in the Pisgah National Forest, Christmount in Black Mountain. We found this sweet spot last minute when we were looking for a place to decompress after our wedding and it did not disappoint. Lisa was very thoughtful in planning this space for ease of use. The walk in shower was delightful. And we slept like the dead in the queen sized bed with the windows open. Great coffee porch for the AM. Lisa was a great unobtrusive yet available host. Please check this place out the next time you want to walk around asheville and to have 3 awesome grocery stores a couple of blocks away! thanks! Lisa could not have been more accommodating. The place was great, the backyard was lovely, and it truly was close to everything! We were there for a wedding weekend, needed some needle & thread and an iron, and Lisa produced it in a matter of minutes. Stay here! A lovely apartment about 20 minutes walking to all the bars and restaurants of downtown. The place is clean, tidy and nicely decorated. We only stayed two nights :( Lisa was helpful and pointed out a couple of fun places to go out and Asheville\\'s Yoga Centre. If you\\'re into yoga make sure you go, even if only once!  Lisa\\'s place is great. It was clean and there are lots of windows. The bed is super comfortable and the linens were of high quality and made for a cozy night\\'s sleep. The wi-fi worked like a charm and we enjoyed the neighborhood very much, the place is within walking distance of downtown and three different grocery stores. Lisa left coffee for us and it was delicious. We\\'d stay here again if we visit Asheville in the future. Great apartment.  Easy walk to town and shopping.  We like having outdoor space and the back deck was perfect.  Bed comfortable, large bedroom and bathroom and everything needed in the kitchen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Lisa for giving us a great fiorst intro to Asheville.\\r\\n\\r\\nEllen This place is top notch airbnb accommodations. We adore Asheville, and this place just iced the cake for our most recent stay.  Clean, spacious, quiet, comfortable, close to everything you could possibly want or need; we didn\\'t want to leave!  I really can\\'t imagine how anyone could be disappointed by the space. Perfect, quiet getaway. Nice neighborhood, gorgeous city, great location, nice people. Wins all around. Super comfortable and charming. Plenty of space for two and your four-legged friends. Great for a getaway. Perfect yard for lounging, reading, drinking coffee, and especially fun for dogs! Location is convenient to downtown. Several great cafes, breweries and restaurants within walking/biking distance.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay at Lisa\\'s place. It is clean, comfortable, and cozy, with a nice big fenced yard for people like us who enjoy traveling with our dogs. There were two issues that appeared as a result of problems of communication and organization:\\r\\n1. She was not there to meet us when we arrived and had not left alternative instructions, which meant that we had to wait around awkwardly to figure what we were supposed to do to get into our place.\\r\\n2. She accused us of not having told her about our dogs, when that had been clearly explained in the first email we sent her. It all worked out in the end, but we did not appreciate the accusatory tone.\\r\\nWith a few adjustments in communication and organization, Lisa\\'s pad could become an excellent place for a stay in Asheville! Lisa is so friendly and accommodating! Very good communication and the place was clean and super cute. Very quick walk to the downtown area and lots of food options! Thanks Lisa! We will be back.   What a cozy and comfortable place.  Walking distance to everything we needed.  Loved it! We stayed at Lisa and Davids over the Christmas Holiday. It was quiet and comfortable in the apartment but when we felt like getting out into the crowd it was only a short walk into town. There we found many art galleries, unique shops, and outstanding restaurants. We spent a few quiet evenings preparing dinners in the apartment. Though the kitchen is small and minimal, it has everything you need to put together a warm, delicious meal.\\r\\nWe brought Jagger, our yellow lab, along to enjoy the trip and he had a chance to meet Lisa and Davids dog, Lunar. They hit it off and had some fun chasing each other around the fenced in yard.\\r\\nLunar was very pleasant and an unexpected treat for us...and Jagger. If you are traveling with a dog, this is a great place to stay and Asheville is a very dog-friendly town. Our experience at Lisa and David\\'s house was great! Their separate apartment was very clean and spacious. It was in a great location and was exactly what we had hoped for. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a quick vacation in Asheville.  I stayed in Lisa and David\\'s downstairs apartment with my boyfriend and one of our friends for two nights. Overall the experience was pleasant but there were some shortfalls of note. The listing states: \"I do not charge a cleaning fee in order to keep your cost down and myself sane. Just do your best to leave it in the same condition you found it. I\\'ll do details and the laundry,\" but in fact, Lisa\\'s welcome letter instructs guests to wipe down surfaces and bathroom with cleaning product, strip sheets, begin laundry, remake the bed, and sweep or mop the floors. If the guest prefers not to do so, a 100$ cleaning fee is collected instead. I don\\'t consider this a basic fee nor is it true to the advertised details. The photo advertises a futon-style couch in the living room that I assumed would serve as the additional bed. Rather, a foam mattress was placed on the floor and the top blanket was coated with dog hair. The apartment was a bit cold at night and we could not figure out the wall heater in the living room area. Otherwise, the apartment was suitable for our needs. It was walking distance to the downtown area. This place is a gem.  While below the main house, the ceilings are high and lots of window allow the place to feel warm and inviting. Communications with the host was clear and smooth.  Now let\\'s talk about location. This area of Asheville is booming. you are within easy walking distance from downtown and also there is a grocery store and new Trade Joes just up this street.  I would recommend this place and stay here about!  As described, it is a cozy basement apartment right outside of downtown.  This is a great basement apartment very close to downtown! My fiancé and I were looking for an easy weekend escape with our dog and we are so glad we stumbled across this property. It only takes 10 minutes to walk downtown, very close to multiple grocery stores and the yard is sizable, fenced in and perfect for a dog! We enjoyed our stay at this property and would recommend it to others.  This was a wonderful spot.  The place was clean and comfortable and in a great location-close to downtown and the University.  A fun neighborhood to walk around.  Everything was easy; we got a warm welcome and some info about the area/restaurants from Lisa, she made us feel comfortable and relaxed.  She was there if we had any issues or questions, but she was never intrusive.  An excellent host.  This is the perfect place to explore Asheville, especially if you have a dog.  We hope to visit again soon.  Thanks! I did not meet Lisa but Michele sent me a detailed email & a simple welcome at the apartment. She was very nice and easy to stay in touch with. They included a folder of recommended restaurants and guides for guests. The basement apartment was cozy, clean, and a short 10 min walk to downtown. As another reviewer had mentioned, the blanket for the living room guest was covered in pet hair, so we just took the liberty to wash it due to allergies (the laundry room is located right next to the entrance). Do note that the shower faucet is reversed. Overall, this is definitely a gem. Lisa also has a very cute & friendly pitbull! This place -- basically, a charming apartment on the bottom floor of a house -- was a perfect place to stay. The space itself is super. Relaxed, cozy and tasty. Comfy, firm beds. Plenty of towels. A giant bathroom. A deck just off the kitchen area. And big backyard. Super convenient to Green Life, one of our favorite stores and walkable to downtown. And we loved the neighborhood, which reminded us a little of Venice, California -- in that it was nice, safe with lots of character and well-loved homes, yet without a sense of middle-class fussiness. Very Asheville artsy. Lisa and Michele have everything perfectly organized. They were both there to greet us. And we\\'re instantly available by text. We will definitely stay here again. The space was perfect for what I was looking for.  Close to the downtown area with plenty to do.  Lisa gave great directions to a couple of great places that I took full advantage of.   The apartment is beautifully maintained and perfectly located. And just the right spot if you\\'re traveling with your dogs! Our pups loved the gorgeous backyard. Lisa made it very easy for us to explore the city thanks to the very helpful guide she left for us. Asheville is a true gem and we cannot wait to come back! Great place in a cute residential neighborhood! Easy walk to downtown Asheville. Checking in was easy, and the hosts provided a helpful \"guide\" to all their favorite local businesses. Comfortable bed and spacious bathroom! Great space, great location, and great value. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! Everything was exactly how it was described. Cozy, clean, and well appointed. That bathroom - amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that we were able to bring our 2 dogs with no problems was the big seller here. The coziness, along with the great location in relation to town, made it the perfect place to help me along in asking my beautiful lady to marry me (she said yes!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you Lisa - we hope to be back again for our anniversaries. Fantastic lower floor unit.  Everything you need to enjoy Asheville for a week or weekend:  Easy 10-15 min walk to downtown, Comfortable bed, Free wifi, Kitchen with cooktop, Immaculately updated bathroom, Fenced in backyard for the dog to run around, and, Extremely gracious hosts.  Highly recommended.  I will be coming back to stay if/when I can plan my next trip out. My friends and I loved this place and location. I found it so charming and clean, and the backyard was so nice to have. The only place we drove to was West Asheville, which wasn\\'t far away. We were just tired from hiking all day.\\r\\n\\r\\nHighly recommended! I absolutely loved this place. It was a perfect spot for us and our dog Sophie.  We loved the area where the house was located, it was pretty quiet and we really liked the fenced in yard.  The inside of the house was very homie and comfortable.  Downtown Asheville was very close, about a 10-15 min walk I\\'d say, and even faster by bicycle.  We were also very close to the freeway which made things very convenient.  Although our host Lisa wasn\\'t around during our stay (but still available by phone if needed), her partner Michele was and she was excellent.  All I can say is that we had a great time, and we would most definitely stay at this house again.  Thanks again Lisa and Michele! Expectations were met and exceeded! What a great place to stay for a few days in Asheville! My bf and I enjoyed the location, the comfy bed and decor, and the beyond pleasant interactions with Michele and Lisa. I have already recommended this place to everyone I know. Great backyard for dogs-- we wish we had one just for the backyard! I have to say that the fan in the bedroom was AMAZING. Cool sheets, cool fan, and warm jammies... You get the idea ;) The bathroom was great-- what a cool shower! Good pressure, clean, and refreshing. This is THE place to stay in Asheville. Thank you, Michele and Lisa! We loved it here. As an architectural designer, I was really impressed with the interior finishes of the apartment in the downstairs. I loved the paint colors and choices of warm woods. The bathroom is also very luxurious in size. Everything was clean and amazingly hospitable (fresh linens, coffee, cleaning products, etc.). It was a convenient bike ride to downtown. We were completely able to avoid the hassle of downtown parking. In the evenings, we came back to the house to sit on the porch with a cold beer and watch our dog play in the backyard that was filled with fire flies. \\r\\n We had a wonderful stay at Ashville. Our host provided wonderful accommodation. We just loved the Cabin in the City after a few reservations snafu, things where straightened out and the lodging was wonderful. It was all about making sure we where happy.  The listing description was accurate. Lisa was there to greet us when we arrived and show us around the apartment. We had our own key and driveway access. The apartment was cozy and comfortable, and the bathroom was very roomy - with a tiny private toilet \"closet\" (with its own private fan). We had very reliable and fast wifi, which is extremely important to us, since we own our own businesses and need convenient and dependable access - and we were also able to stream Netflix when we wished. The bed was comfortable, and I particularly liked the smoothness of the sheets. Lots of counterspace and room for our \"stuff\" was also a detail that I appreciated.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere were a few relatively minor details that in the grand scheme of things, were not terribly significant, and I don\\'t think they ought deter anyone from looking at this listing. They may be things that are only important to us. We mention them only in the spirit of continued improvement:\\r\\n\\r\\nA couple of minor maintenance issues:\\r\\n1. The showerhead has a leak.\\r\\n2. The bushes along the driveway are overgrown, making it difficult to get in and out of your vehicle, especially to load and unload bags.\\r\\n3. There was no broom and dustpan that we could find, only a Swiffer when we went to do the cleaning our last morning.\\r\\n4. The coffeemaker, even with the filter and coffee in it, the cup didn\\'t weigh enough to compress the spring that opens the valve to let the coffee in the pot... So when we went to make coffee, the filter cup filled up with water and we had a mess to clean up.\\r\\n\\r\\n5. We didn\\'t know until we went to change the sheets the last morning, that underneath the pillow cases, the pillows were pretty stained. \\r\\n6. Our first morning, there were a dozen or so ants around the kitchen sink. The only food we\\'d had was takeout the night before, that went directly into the trashcan.. so there was no food debris on the counter/sink to have attracted them. There were also a few bugs - pillbug and lightning bug and something else? that we found in the bed. \\r\\n\\r\\nOnce again, all these are pretty minor issues, easily fixable with little or no expense, and even taken together, would not deter us from staying here again. We really liked the space, and the convenience to downtown was terrific. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Lisa and Michelle were fabulous hosts. Both were easy to reach with questions about our stay (before and during the trip). Their welcome sheet/info book were very helpful. \\r\\nThe location was excellent and the house was as described. We loved it and will definitely look to stay there again when we return. \\r\\nWe didnt bring our dog this trip, but the house and yard would\\'ve been great if we had. We loved drinking our morning coffee on the cute back patio! \\r\\nVery convenient to downtown (walkable, although also a very affordable cab ride). \\r\\nOverall, an excellent stay.  This place was in a perfect location! It was within easy walking distance to downtown and 3 grocery stores! The host was flexible with the meeting time and met us at the house, showed us around and had a great book with local restaurants, flyers for outdoor activities, etc which made our stay much easier!  We enjoyed our stay at Lisa\\'s apartment.  It was conveniently located and had plenty of space.  The fenced yard for our dog was great to have.  I would definitely recommend and would stay there again if I was in the area.  The reservation was canceled 77 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We had such a lovely time staying at Lisa\\'s place in Asheville. The apartment is huge (even bigger than what the photos show) and very clean. It also has a huge and well-kept backyard and deck where we enjoyed happy hour each evening before heading out.  The location couldn\\'t be more convenient - it\\'s a quick walk to downtown and right around the corner from three grocery stores. We met directly with Lisa\\'s friend, Michelle, who gave some great recommendations on things to do/eat around town. Check-in/check-out was a breeze. We definitely recommend it and can\\'t wait to come back! We had a great stay at Lisa\\'s place. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated, and the yard was the perfect place for our dog to spend the afternoon while we went out and explored. The house is really easy to access from the highway, and is set in a charming little neighborhood with lots of gardens and plenty of peace and quiet. Michelle was waiting for us right when we arrived and pointed out everything we needed to know. We would happily stay here again. My girlfriend and I wanted to stay in a nice, clean private unit that was within a short walking distance of downtown Asheville and this was the perfect place for that experience.  The place was very clean, nice big comfy bed and the bathroom was super clean and very spacious.  The little deck and dining table out back was perfect for a morning coffee or an evening cocktail.  The 15 minute walk to downtown was easy and took you straight onto Lexington Ave or Broadway depending upon which way you took, either way it puts you right into the heart of shopping, dining and exploring.  There is a new Harris Teeter and Trader Joe\\'s five minutes from the unit and a Whole Goods (Greenlife) right down the street as well, super convenient for getting everyday needs.  If you\\'re into vegetarian fare the restaurant Plant is only a five minute walk and has excellent food.  Coffee and half n half were also provided which was a nice perk and only further enhanced the experience that Michele and Lisa offered.  We would definitely like to return but next time for longer than three nights!!  Little Woodrow was adorable. There\\'s plenty of space for two people to spend a few days - in addition to the bedroom, there\\'s a small living room area with vintage couch and coffee table, and a really cute kitchen with a full-size fridge, a microwave, and a hot plate. We were in town for four days, so we appreciated being able to pick up a few groceries and make breakfast and coffee in the kitchen before we went out for the day. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a lot of space for clothes in the dresser and closet. The bathroom has a nice large shower and a his-and-hers sink. Overall a very pleasant accommodation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only downside was the noise of people upstairs. From the bedroom you will definitely hear people walking (or, in the case of small children, running). Our first two mornings we were awakened early by the sound of three children running overhead. Our last three mornings (after that family left), we were barely disturbed by noise from the new, childless, tenants.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll-and-all, a charming and remarkably comfortable unit. Walked to the store our first evening. Terrific location; all of Asheville seems to be less than 10 minutes away by car. Thank you, Michelle and Lisa! Our stay at this basement apartment was wonderful. The perfect size for two. The bed was super comfy. Everything was as described-except I was disappointed there wasn\\'t an oven like one picture showed-but we managed. The backyard was so pretty, especially when it rained. We DID walk everywhere! Thank you, girls! Host was very nice. Place was comfortable, however, please get different toilet paper! Nice little place to stay for a few days and unwind.  Nice backyard for the dog, and for drinking your morning coffee.  It\\'s really close to the Blue Ridge parkway, making it easy to drive out for day hikes.  Also close to downtown if that\\'s your thing.  Walk if you like, but there are public parking garages straight down the road. Enjoyed a very pleasant stay at a very convenient location! We had everything we needed in this gorgeous, spacious apartment. This space was the perfect place to stay the night in Asheville with my mom visiting. The place is very spacious, and has every ammenity necessary to feel right at home. We loved coffee on the deck in the morning, and the feeling of being in such a cozy neighborhood.  I had a great first airbnb experience staying at Lisa\\'s place. Michele met us at the place and gave us a quick run through and answered our questions. Great location and comfortable basement apartment. Thanks! Lovely little place for a weekend getaway! No complaints- but did also notice some ants in the kitchen.  My group had a great experience staying here. The place was clean and the photos clearly depicted what we would be walking into. We were greeted by Michele who was flexible with our check in time. She answered any questions we had about Asheville and wished us well. The location to the many attractions in Asheville was perfect, even if we had to take a quick Uber cab to get where we needed, nothing seemed more than 5 minutes away. Lisa and Michele were very accommodating to our arrival time, easy to get ahold of via text for updates/changes, and it was a great location to explore Ashevillle! Its a very cute orange house with easy private access and driveway parking. My husband and I were able to walk or use UBER ($7 ride to anywhere/from anywhere downtown) to get anywhere we wanted and truly enjoyed our stay. Would strongly recommend!  Michele and Lisa allowed us to check in an hour early which was very helpful and much appreciated, but I have to say afterwards it went a bit downhill. There was a pillow on the bed that I returned to the host because it had some blood on it from a previous guest. The top sheets also had an odd burn mark, and the ants were quite bad if you set anything down in the kitchen counters they were swarming pretty quickly, luckily we didnt have any food in the house. All of this I can overlook because things are not going to be perfect, but the most upsetting was the lack of consideration by the hosts (Email hidden by Airbnb) 12:45 am we were awakened by a loud noise. There was a person that was up and moving things around upstairs for almost 2 hours. It was EXTREMELY loud and we did not get good sleep because it carried on for so long. I was using the listing only for somewhere to sleep since we were out and about the whole time and We had to drive several hours to get back home the following day which was not easy. If you are looking to sleep well....this is not the place for you, it is not insulated , we could hear the hosts phones on vibrate starting early the following morning as well. Shower was great, hot and good pressure, I would suggest as well to do a sweep of the many cob webs. Location was great as well. Sorry but just not for me:( Really enjoyed our stay here. The house was very clean, well equipped, and conveniently located. Would highly recommend it, especially to those looking for a pet-friendly option - was great to have a background for our dog to run around in. \\r\\n\\r\\nLisa and Michele are great hosts - very friendly and quick to respond. Instructions for the house were clearly written and very helpful. It\\'s clear they put a lot of effort into making guests feel welcomed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould definitely stay here again!  Michele was wonderful, she was very accommodating, the location was great (short walk into downtown), and the apartment was very clean and seemed to be newly remodeled. We would definitely go back! We had no issues finding or getting let in to the house. The listing seemed accurate and our dog loved the fenced back yard. We were able to walk to restaurants, grocery stores and downtown (although downtown was not a quick walk, we had no problem getting there). Overall, we had a great time in Asheville! The house was great with a fantastic location between downtown and UNC Asheville.  Clean and cozy and perfect for a restful night.  There is someone upstairs but she was very quiet and distant disturb us at all.  It was very comfortable for three guests plus a baby and dog.  Backyard  is fenced and private and street felt safe.  Full kitchen, easy internet access and large bathroom.  Close to many coffee shops, restaurants and grocery stores. Would highly recommend! Although we never met Lisa, the place was great and clean and in a wonderful location. No complaints! Michele was there to greet us right when we arrived. They left us a binder full of wonderful restaurant ideas. Michele and Lisa were available when needed, and extremely communicative which is a big thing for me. We had an amazing time and would definitely return. The neighborhood was great and the neighbors were very friendly. Downtown Asheville was about a mile away, and grocery stores such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe\\'s were even closer. The living space was very comfortable and nice. We fit three people comfortably on a bed and a pullout futon. The WiFi was fast, there were kitchen amenities, and the shower was extremely nice. We had no complaints!  Welcoming, clean, and great location! Chris\\'s house was a perfect home base for us to explore Asheville!  Lisa was a great host. She gave us directions into town, answered questions promptly and was really nice to deal with. The apartment was as described: ground floor/basement with nice vista onto the garden, with a small back porch. The kitchen has a dishwasher, microwave, coffee maker, two plate stovetop, refrigerator. There is a very nice bedroom and shower and a comfortable small sitting area.  Great wifi. The neighborhood is unprepossessing, but about 5 long blocks to town, friendly & quiet. Near Trader Joes. Some noise can be heard from guests upstairs walking about, but it was not too bad. Off street parking. Recommended. We enjoyed our time in Lisa\\'s apartment. It was nicely decorated and peaceful and had a lovely yard. Lisa was very welcoming and told us of several places to eat, and what we could find in the area. The location was perfect and convenient to everything. Downtown was only minutes away, we walked to the grocery store just a 10 minute pleasant walk.  Very clean, well kept apartment. Neighborhood is nice, quiet and close to town (parking is easy in the driveway). The walk to town is less than 10 minutes or a quick uber ride away. Lisa was easy to work with and I would recommend this place as a great choice to stay close to downtown Asheville. Host was very nice and welcoming.  Place was cute and location convenient.  Our only complaint is that if there are guests staying upstairs you will hear their every move.  Also, there seemed to be a lot of laundry being done while we were there and the machines are very loud. Great place ! Super convenient and not too far from downtown. Had an awesome time !  The apartment is not really as pictured.  Since there is no stove, the pictures should be changed.  There is no picture of the 2nd bed but it is even smaller than a single bed, stuck in a nook.  The outside is in need of repair since the walkway has crumbled at the bottom & you have to be careful not to fall.  I am a dog owner but there must have been many dogs in the bedroom since I was on the verge of an asthma attack both nights.   I left the place as neat as could be only leaving out the sweeping & even took the trash with me as her bins were full.  I texted her to see if everything was ok & after 5 texts she responded that it was ok.  No enthusiasm there & no thanks even though she told me check out was an hour earlier than posted.  She had other guest on their way !!!   I would NOT recommend it for more that 2 people & 1 child & if you are planning on cooking there since there is only a 2 burner stove top & a very small toaster over. Lisa\\'s place was great - super clean (which is really important to me) and walkable to downtown.  She was easy to deal with and went out of her way to get us a DVD player so we could watch movies as the week was predicted to be rainy.  She also gave us a great recommendation to hike Roan Mountain on our way into Asheville as Sunday was sunny and gorgeous - and as mentioned previously the weather report was not promising for a couple of outdoor enthusiasts.  I would give two heads up - one, the only bathroom is inside the bedroom.  Could or could not be a problem for your group. Two, this probably applies to us more than others and we didn\\'t do a good enough job sussing out the situation. We love to spend the day hiking and then come home and cook.  The cooking facilities were somewhat limited and there were no pantry products - sugar, flour. spices - to speak of.  If you are people who just plan to eat breakfast at home then no worries - and Lisa did leave coffee, orange juice and cream which was very nice. There are three grocery stores and lots of great restaurants within walking distance so you definitely won\\'t go hungry!  All in all it was a good experience and I would recommend this place.  If you travel with pets (which we did not this time) it\\'s definitely a winner.   Lisa worked closely with us and made sure everything was taken care of.   There was a slight hiccup but she addressed it quickly and professionally.  Thank you!  House worked out great. Lisa, the space, the neighbors and neighborhood are all wonderful. I rented here for 2 months as a new resident looking for a longer term rental in another area and the whole experience has helped me to feel right at home. Im very thankful.  Nice place to stay! It’s the downstairs unit but it has a nice little porch on the back with a nice fenced in backyard if you have a dog. Lisa\\'s place was perfect for us. We could easily walk to downtown to bars, shops and restaurants, and 3 grocery stores were just a couple blocks away. The neighborhood is convenient, cute and low-key. \\n\\nThe space was comfortable, and perfect for us to work in and use as base for mtn biking and hiking trips. \\n\\nAlso, the big back yard was awesome for our dog!\\n\\nLisa herself was welcoming and easy to communicate with. Would come back for sure! Please look at the pictures closely and read the captions. There is not a range stove and oven, just a toaster oven and a small electric two-top stove. The location is nice as it\\'s very close to downtown, however, I really didn\\'t enjoy my stay. The couch and bed are very uncomfortable and need to be replaced. There is little to no insulation between this downstairs unit and the main house upstairs so you will hear your neighbors. Lisa is a nice host and I enjoyed meeting her but I would not stay here again and would only recommend it for a long weekend or maybe a week tops when you plan to be gone most of the time.  Lisa is an exceptional host and appreciated her knowledge of the local places to check out!  Very close walking distance to downtown bars and eateries! Great location - very walkable! Great place Lisa\\'s place was the perfect introduction to Asheville living.  She was responsive and helped to make me feel right at home.  I loved the neighborhood and my dog enjoyed the large yard and windows that let in lots of sunshine!  Would definitely recommend this space to anyone visiting Asheville in the future!  Thanks Lisa!'"
